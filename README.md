# Student-Course-Management-System-project
This project is a simple MySQL-based Student Course Management System created to practice database design, table creation, and SQL queries. It simulates a small college environment where students can enroll in different courses.
The database contains three tables:

students – stores basic student details

courses – stores information about each course

enrollments – links students to the courses they take

This small project helped me understand how primary keys, foreign keys, relationships, and JOIN queries work in a real database.
It’s a beginner-friendly SQL project that demonstrates:
✔ Database creation
✔ Table design
✔ Data insertion
✔ Relational joins
✔ Filtering & grouping queries

The project is perfect for showcasing fundamental SQL skills and understanding of relational databases.
